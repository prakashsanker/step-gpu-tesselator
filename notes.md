TODOs

1. The step file parsing takes a long time --> this is a candidate for optimization.
2. Step file parsing is also not super robust. It's probably worth spinning this out to be another service. Looks like there are a lot of other open source tools out there.
3. Once I have this, I think it's worth making the rendering faster (if needed)
